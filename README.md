# Higher or Lower Number Guessing Game

Higher or Lower is a Python terminal game. It runs in the Code Institute's mock terminal on Heroku. 



It is a number guessing game where users try to guess a specific number correctly. This is a random number generated by the computer between 1 and 100. The user has 5 attempts to guess the correct number. If they guess the correct number in 5 guesses then they win the game, otherwise they lose. After each guess, the number of remaining guesses will be displayed on the screen. The game gives hints to the user after each guess, where they advise the user if the number they are trying to guess is higher or lower than the last number they guessed. 



The main function of this game is to provide the user with a simple number guessing game. It allows the user to have fun and try to guess a random number generated by the computer.

## User Stories


### As a user I would like to see a simple explanation of the game and how to play. 

Before beginning the game a welcome message is displayed. This provides details of how to play the game to the user. The user is advised that they must choose a number between 1 and 100 and try to guess a mystery/ target number. The user is also informed that they will have 5 chances to guess the correct number. 

Once the game has started, the user is prompted to provide the required information. They are asked "Please choose a number between 1 and 100". This signals to the user where to enter their guess and re- affirms that their guess must be a number between 1 and 100. 

When the game is over the user receives a message. The messaging is user-focused in that it congratulates the user on winning, and also provides a sympathetic message if the user loses the game. 



### As a user I would like to enter my name at the welcome screen

- Below the initial welcome message the user is asked to enter their name. Once the user enters their name, a messasge is displayed in the terminal welcoming that person to the game using the name/ username that they have entered. The users name is also used in the congratuliations message if they win the game or the message that displays when they lose the game. This adds a more personal touch to the game for the user. 


- The user can enter a name or username of their choice. The name is not limited to strings to allow users to enter a name of their choosing which may contain words, numbers or a combination of both.


### As a user I would like participate in the game and to enter a guess 

- The user can participate in the game and make a guess by following the prompts on screen. They are asked guess a number between 1 and 100. Once the user has made their guess, this will be checked to see if it matches the target number. 


- If the user has guessed the correct number a congratulations message will display on screen. This message will include the player name and advise them that they have chosen the correct number and have won the game.


- If the user has not guessed correctly they will be prompted to enter another guess. If the correct number is not guessed this will continue until the user has used up all 5 guesses. 



### As a user I would like to see my remaining guesses clearly displayed. 

- When a user enters a guess, the guess is evaluated. In the beginning of the game, the user starts with 5 guesses/ chances. After each incorrect guess, the number of remaining guesses is reduced by one. These are displayed on the screen and represented by the letter 'X'. Text above reads "Remaining Guesses" letting the user know that each 'X' represents a remaining guess for the user. 


### As a user I would like to see if my guess is correct or not

- After a guess is made by the user and the guess has been evaluated text is displayed in the terminal. This advises the user if their guess was correct and they won or if it was incorrect. It also gives the user a hint to make it easier to narrow down where the correct answer might be. If the users guess is incorrect they are prompted to make another guess. 

### As a user I would like to see if the correct answer is higher or lower than my guess

- When a user enters their guess a message is displayed to the user stating whether the correct answer is higher or lower than their guess. The numeber the user has chosen is also displayed in the message. This gives the user an indication of the range in which their next guess should be. 

The messages are:
- You chose ..., the correct answer is higher!
- You chose ..., the correct answer is lower. 

### As a user I would like to know when the game is over and what the correct number was

- Once the user has made 5 incorrect guesses the game will end. A GAME OVER message is displayed on screen. A message is displyed to the user, including their name. It also advises the user of what the correct number was. The game over message is "GAME OVER". "You lose {username}. The correct number was {target number}. Better luck next time"
