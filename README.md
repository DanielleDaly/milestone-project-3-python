# Higher or Lower Number Guessing Game

Higher or Lower is a Python terminal game. It runs in the Code Institute's mock terminal on Heroku. 



It is a number guessing game where users try to guess a specific number correctly. This is a random number generated by the computer between 1 and 100. The user has 5 attempts to guess the correct number. If they guess the correct number in 5 guesses then they win the game, otherwise they lose. After each guess, the number of remaining guesses will be displayed on the screen. The game gives hints to the user after each guess, where they advise the user if the number they are trying to guess is higher or lower than the last number they guessed. 



The main function of this game is to provide the user with a simple number guessing game. It allows the user to have fun and try to guess a random number generated by the computer.
